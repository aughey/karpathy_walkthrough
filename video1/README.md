# karpathy_walkthrough

A write-along implementation of Andrej Karpathy's neural network tutorials from his YouTube series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0

This project follows along with the "Neural Networks: Zero to Hero" series, implementing the concepts and code examples in real-time to build a deeper understanding of neural networks from the ground up.

- [Video 1](https://youtu.be/VMj-3S1tku0?si=ktZoKgNK0FsFbMyt) - The spelled-out intro to neural networks and backpropagation: building micrograd
    - This is a must-see for anyone who wants to understand the basics of neural networks and backpropagation.  Break out Jupyter notebook and follow along and don't move along until you understand backpropagation.
