# karpathy_walkthrough

A write-along implementation of Andrej Karpathy's neural network tutorials from his YouTube series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0

This project follows along with the "Neural Networks: Zero to Hero" series, implementing the concepts and code examples in real-time to build a deeper understanding of neural networks from the ground up.
